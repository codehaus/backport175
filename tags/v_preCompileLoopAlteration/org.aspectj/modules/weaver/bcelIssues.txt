* updateTarget doesn't work with exnTargets, in particular, when the startPC and endPC are the same handle.

* RemoveNOP doesn't work properly with exnTargets (and, much less importantly, local variable tables), 
  because it always retargets to the NEXT instruction... the endPC should retarget to the LAST instruction.
  
* parameter names aren't set correctly (to anything) when a MethodGen is read from a Method.

* the superclassname of java.lang.object is set to java.lang.object (!!)

* RET should be a local variable instruction
